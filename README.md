* This project was developed using a GitPod workspace. The code was commited to Git and pushed to GitHub using the terminal.

* Log in to [Heroku](https://id.heroku.com/login) or create an account
* On the main page click New and Create New App
* Note: new app name must be unique
* Next select your region, I chose Europe.
* Click Create App button
* Click in resources and select Heroku Postgres database
* Click Reveal Config Vars and add new config "SECRET_KEY"
* Click Reveal Config Vars and add new config "CLOUDINARY_URL"
* Click Reveal Config Vars and add new config "DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC = 1"
* The next page is the projectâ€™s Deploy Tab. Click on the Settings Tab and scroll down to Config Vars
* Next, go to Buildpack section click Add Buildpack select python and Save Changes
* Scroll to the top of the page and choose the Deploy tab
* Select Github as the deployment method
* Confirm you want to connect to GitHub
* Search for the repository name and click the connect button
* Scroll to the bottom of the deploy page and select the preferred deployment type
* Click either Enable Automatic Deploys for automatic deployment when you push updates to Github

### Final Deployment 

* Create a runtime.txt `python-3.8.13`
* Create a Procfile `web: gunicorn heardit.wsgi`
* When development is complete change the debug setting to: `DEBUG = False` in settings.py
* In this project the summernote editor was used so for this to work in Heroku add: `X_FRAME_OPTIONS = SAMEORIGIN `to
   settings.py.
* In Heroku settings, delete the config vars for `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC = 1`
